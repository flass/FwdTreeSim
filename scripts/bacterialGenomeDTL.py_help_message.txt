Usage:
python /home/flassall/github_flass/FwdTreeSim/scripts/bacterialGenomeDTL.py [options]
Options:
  General options:
	-o  --outputdir path		directory for all output files #	defaults to current directory.
  Simulation parameters:
  __Species/Genomes population layer__:
	-s  --popsize		int		number of species to simulate in the underlying Moran process	# default: 100.
	-g  --ngen   		int		number of generations for which the evolution is simulated	# default: 1000.
	-c  --connect.lineages	float		the multiple species lineage trees from the Moran process' population will
						all be connected at their root. The length of branches of the star-like
						root is given by the argument, negative value turns it off.
						# default: 0 (on).
  __Gene/Locus layer__:
	-p  --profiles  path			JSON file containing the (multiple) evolutionary profiles for simulated gene families, 
						and their respective weights (sampling probability if <=1 or expected number of gene families if >1).
						See FwdTreeSim/example/DTLprofiles.json for file format example.
						Example pangenome structure (with 20% core, 20% accessory, 60% orfan gene families)
						can be generated by replacing path by an empty string ''. 
	-n  --ngenes    int			number of gene families to simulate in the pangenome
						# default: 10; overriden by providing gene family profiles.
	-r  --dtlrates  float[,float[,float]]	global rates of Duplication, Transfer and Loss for ALL simulated gene families.
						# default: D=0.001 T=D, L=D+T; overriden by providing gene family profiles.
	-f  --rootfreq  float			global presence probability for ALL the gene families
						at the root of the simulation of the species population.
						# default: 0.5 ; overriden by providing gene family profiles.
  Output options:
	-e  --sample.extant.species	int	how many genomes are sampled in the end? trees are pruned accordingly
						# default: all sampled.
	-l  --sample.larger.trees	int	how many lineage gene trees from a gene family population should be written out?
						Can be handy to just carry a diagnostic the simulated trees.
						# default: all lineage trees written as a single connected tree.
